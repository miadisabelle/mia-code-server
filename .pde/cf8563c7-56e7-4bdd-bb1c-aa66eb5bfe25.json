  "prompt": "Session context: A human (Ava) is working with multiple LLM agents simultaneously on mia-code-server. One agent (Agent B, likely Gemini) just committed a large body of work — 5 rispecs for smcraft integration, an SMDF state-machine example, and KINSHIP bridge updates. Before the agent committed, Ava edited the .pde/ files to inject her own annotations and intent into the agent's decomposition — essentially co-authoring the agent's task list in real-time. The human now asks to understand the deeper pattern through story.",
