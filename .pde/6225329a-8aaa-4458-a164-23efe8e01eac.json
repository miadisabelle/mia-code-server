  "prompt": "using the @llms/llms-rise-framework.txt  you will study `/src/mia-code/` and `/src/Miadi/` (they both also should have a ./rispecs for their corresponding to code implementation RISE Framework files) and this fork of 'code-server' would be rebranded 'mia-code-server' (so you need to change any packaging, references etc so it can be published as that, this is your mission no 1.  Mission number 2 is that the 2 studies you did of `/src/mia-code/` and `/src/Miadi/` should reveal many patterns and implementation that we will want todo to host these 2 codebase into a server like 'code-server' (if you want, all that is developped in  `/src/Miadi/` does not deliver what it should, therefore, you will identify core component that could help us implement that in here.  `/src/mia-code/miaco` contains a great 'coDevOps' CLI that should become a module or something for the main 'mia-code' and also a similar implementation is made into `/src/Miadi/miadi-code` for agentic presence within the IDE such as this code-server (becoming 'mia-code-server').  You will draft from these studies and conceptualization of what you envision a maximum of 100 specs in ./rispecs/ (you can create subfolders to organize that into adequate libraries/components/modules or whatever you call it). I know that in ./libs/vscode is a submodule of repo microsoft/vscode and we might have to make a version for ourselves by implementing our work in there, I already forked it in repo \"git@github.com:miadisabelle/mia-vscode.git\" so changing the submodule to that repo might be one of the things to plan, thought focus on writing the ./rispecs/mia-vscode/ first but analyzing what we should do to have this whole agentic tooling developped in these platform in here should be what we envision (I am expecting probably at least 50 specs in your first run).  As measure, If I give these specs to another LLM, he should be capable to fully implement that.",
