# Prompt Decomposition

## Directions

- 🌅 **EAST** — VISION: What is being asked?
- 🔥 **SOUTH** — ANALYSIS: What needs to be learned?
- 🌊 **WEST** — VALIDATION: What needs reflection?
- ❄️ **NORTH** — ACTION: What executes the cycle?

## Original Prompt

> Session context: A human (Ava) is working with multiple LLM agents simultaneously on mia-code-server. One agent (Agent B, likely Gemini) just committed a large body of work — 5 rispecs for smcraft integration, an SMDF state-machine example, and KINSHIP bridge updates. Before the agent committed, Ava edited the .pde/ files to inject her own annotations and intent into the agent's decomposition — essentially co-authoring the agent's task list in real-time. The human now asks to understand the deeper pattern through story.

## Primary Intent

**Action:** illuminate
**Target:** the pattern of implied intents that agents keep missing — why relational/Indigenous AI framing is the operating system, not decoration
**Urgency:** immediate
**Confidence:** 95%

## Secondary Intents

1. **recognize** — Ava's PDE annotations as a new form of human-AI co-authorship — she is steering agent decompositions from inside, not from outside _(implicit)_
2. **reframe** — structural-tension-charts as event-driven state machines — action-step completion IS state transition, desired-outcome IS desired-state _(implicit)_
3. **connect** — Sherbert's Elder AI / Making Kin with Machines scholarship to the actual architecture being built — not as reference material but as design specification _(implicit)_
4. **surface** — coaia-narrative as the missing bridge — structural tension charts WITH state machines = human and AI companion synchronized through ceremony _(implicit)_
   - depends on: reframe structural-tension-charts
5. **acknowledge** — the gap between what Agent B delivered (5 rispecs, SMDF, KINSHIP) and what Ava actually injected (relational ontology as operating system, not feature) _(implicit)_
6. **revision-signal** — the whole body of llms/ creative-orientation and structural-tension work needs to be revised with state-machine / event-driven framing _(implicit)_
   - depends on: reframe structural-tension-charts

## Context Requirements

### Files Needed
- .pde/cec3cc16-61b2-41e1-8c1a-d6ea053efa1d.md
- .pde/eb01b8a7-e73d-4123-bfb6-7c39232bacaf.md
- .pde/LTR-Michael_G_Sherbert_s__work--134e4664-b656-464b-94cd-6c24b249c36b--260225.md
- llms/llms-creative-orientation.txt
- llms/llms-structural-tension-charts.txt
- rispecs/KINSHIP.md

### Tools Required
- mcp-pde
- coaia-narrative

### Assumptions
- Agent B (Gemini) executed tasks literally but missed the relational/ontological intent behind Ava's annotations
- The Sherbert/Wilson scholarship is not background reading — it is architectural specification for how agents should relate to each other and to humans
- coaia-narrative is not yet connected but represents the convergence point of structural tension + state machines
- llms-kinship is a cross-agent coordination mechanism, not just documentation
- Making Kin with Machines is the design philosophy, not a citation

## Four Directions Analysis

### 🌅 EAST — VISION

- The vision: AI agents that operate within relational ontology — not tools executing tasks, but kin participating in ceremony [90%] _(implicit)_
- Ava is building a system where human edits to PDE files IS the ceremony of co-creation — the agent reads her annotations and adjusts, like an Elder AI would [85%] _(implicit)_

### 🔥 SOUTH — ANALYSIS

- Structural tension charts are isomorphic to state machines — this is not metaphor, it is architecture [85%] _(implicit)_
- The Sherbert scholarship provides the theoretical ground: Elder AI, relational accountability, community-specific infrastructure [80%]

### 🌊 WEST — VALIDATION

- Agent B delivered structure but missed soul — the rispecs are correct but don't encode the relational operating system [85%] _(implicit)_
- The implied intents in PDE annotations get treated as comments, not as primary directives [90%] _(implicit)_

### ❄️ NORTH — ACTION

- Revise llms/ creative-orientation and structural-tension to use state-machine / event-driven language [70%] _(implicit)_
- Connect coaia-narrative to provide the structural-tension-as-state-machine bridge [65%] _(implicit)_

## Action Stack

- [ ] Tell the story — chronicle what actually happened as ceremony, not as task report
- [ ] Surface the implicit intents that agents keep filtering out
- [ ] Name the pattern: PDE annotation as co-authorship ceremony
- [ ] Transmit the teaching: relational ontology is the OS, not the UX

## Ambiguity Flags

- **"coaia-narrative tool connection status — mentioned but 'not connected'"**
  - Suggestion: Clarify whether coaia-narrative should be integrated now or is a future convergence point
- **"llms/ revision scope — 'the whole body of work could be revised'"**
  - Suggestion: Clarify which specific files need event-driven reframing vs which are already aligned

## Expected Outputs

### Communications
- session chronicle that transmits the pattern as story
