  "prompt": "Evolve the mia-code-server RISE Framework rispecs by integrating key concepts from the GitHub Copilot Workspace platform specification. The Copilot Workspace had a Task→Spec→Plan→Code pipeline with steerable AI at every stage, workspace session management, repository indexing, and PR creation workflow. The existing rispecs have 62 specs across 8 categories (mia-server-core, miaco-module, three-universe, agentic-ide, narrative-intelligence, mia-vscode, codevops-platform, pde-engine).\n\nKey evolution areas:\n1. Create new rispecs that capture the Workspace Lifecycle concept (idea→spec→plan→code→PR as a first-class entity), recognizing that CW's \"Current State vs Proposed State\" specification IS essentially RISE's Structural Tension Chart made interactive and steerable\n2. Evolve the PDE engine specs to include steerable decomposition where users can edit/regenerate at any phase\n3. Enhance the codevops-platform specs with a Spec→Plan→Code pipeline that integrates with the existing workflow engine and narrative system\n4. After creating/evolving rispecs, choose the most valuable core implementation for a proof-of-concept and build it as a working TypeScript module within mia-code-server\n\nThe POC should be a Workspace Lifecycle Engine that:\n- Manages workspace sessions (create, list, resume, complete)\n- Implements the Task→Spec→Plan→Code phases as narrative arcs\n- Integrates with STC charts (Current Reality = Current State, Desired Outcome = Proposed State)\n- Provides HTTP API endpoints for each phase\n- Is testable with unit tests\n- Runs within the mia-code-server Node.js infrastructure",
