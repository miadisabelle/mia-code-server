## Purpose

* Link to other potiential project from which we sync/borrow RISE specs for this project
* The first "Copilot Workspace Scaffold" bellow will serve as an example of that

### repo `miadisabelle/MiAICo-251203-CopilotWorkspace-N0v2akS7--CopilotWorkspaceScaffold`
>cloned in : `/workspace/repos/miadisabelle/MiAICo-251203-CopilotWorkspace-N0v2akS7--CopilotWorkspaceScaffold`

* It goes thru my inspiration to bring back to life parts of what "Copilot Workspace" was offering as Agentic Presence while coding.
* Best ways to use that will probably be to consider these as "State Machine" in a sense that in the creative process, we have 3 stages (Germination, Assimilation and Completion) which are 3 states that we could be into with obviously sub-states, events and transitions which has various workflows with obviously action-steps.
* * In relation to this "State Machine" developped in repo `jgwill/smcraft` will be really interesting to study more profoundly. Cloned in `/workspace/repos/jgwill/smcraft`

### repo  `jgwill/smcraft`
>cloned in: `/workspace/repos/jgwill/smcraft` and also being developped in `/b/trading/smcraft` (as it was borned into 'jgwill/caishen' first.
