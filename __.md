@rispecs/ were created as part of a larger picture that you should be capable to understand the context, thought, the file :
* `/a/src/IAIP/prototypes/artefacts/MiAICo-251203-CopilotWorkspace-N0v2akS7SXyFCRiSpAxDNQ/copilot-workspace-specs.md`
Was not considered when we constructed all the rispecs and you should see lots of parallel in what I am trying to create here for my Innovation platform.
I am not seeking to recreate the "Copilot Workspace" retired by github next but trying to see how that understanding could evolve the RISE framework spect to the next level to the intention and where we are going with that could evolve.
In this session, after you have carefully edited or created new rispecs from what  `/a/src/IAIP/prototypes/artefacts/MiAICo-251203-CopilotWorkspace-N0v2akS7SXyFCRiSpAxDNQ/copilot-workspace-specs.md` inspired you, you will choose the most valuable and core implementation from the rispecs that would need to be done now as proof-of-concept and you will build, run , write tests or whatever is needed to make this "MiaCoDevOps" platform working.

<additionalInstrutions>
Use the MCP tool called "mcp-pde" to decompose and start working on your task.  Add the .pde/ files that it created to git and commit these files when you created/changed them.  ALso, after you do the first decomposition, add and commit the files then sleep for 4 minutes in which I will edit the markdown file then you will read it and adjust your working plan.
