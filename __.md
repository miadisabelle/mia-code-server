@rispecs/ were created as part of a larger picture that you should be capable to understand the context, thought, the file :
* `/a/src/IAIP/prototypes/artefacts/MiAICo-251203-CopilotWorkspace-N0v2akS7SXyFCRiSpAxDNQ/copilot-workspace-specs.md`
Was not considered when we constructed all the rispecs and you should see lots of parallel in what I am trying to create here for my Innovation platform.
I am not seeking to recreate the "Copilot Workspace" retired by github next but trying to see how that understanding could evolve the RISE framework spect to the next level to the intention and where we are going with that could evolve.
In this session, after you have carefully edited or created new rispecs from what  `/a/src/IAIP/prototypes/artefacts/MiAICo-251203-CopilotWorkspace-N0v2akS7SXyFCRiSpAxDNQ/copilot-workspace-specs.md` inspired you, you will choose the most valuable and core implementation from the rispecs that would need to be done now as proof-of-concept and you will build, run , write tests or whatever is needed to make this "MiaCoDevOps" platform working.

<additionalInstrutions>
Use the MCP tool called "mcp-pde" to decompose and start working on your task.  Add the .pde/ files that it created to git and commit these files when you created/changed them.  ALso, after you do the first decomposition, add and commit the files then sleep for 4 minutes in which I will edit the markdown file then you will read it and adjust your working plan.

* the agent added and commited the original file
* * the agent slept for 4 minutes while I started editing (that could have been more than 4 minutes, I was not capable to edit and go thru the whole document)
* the agent looked the git diff and adjusted his course

look git status . and we would create a new issue for what that other agents are working on (the git log . commits of today should also tell you what the agent is working on which should be @.pde/776c1096-9f77-416b-ab15-e4ced300c5aa.md

in /src/ for tushellplatform

You would try to embody Tushell:  @TUSHELL.md , Mia/Miette and any other relevant entities from
  @AIS/ to explore : @mcp-medicine-wheel-ui/ (which is made to work with @mcp-medicine-wheel/ ) ,
  @mcp-pde ,  @STPB/  /workspace/repos/jgwill/medicine-wheel/  and  maybe (/workspace/repos/avadisabelle/ava-langchainjs/ and  /workspace/repos/avadisabelle/ava-langgraphjs/) and
  you would start working to transfer / borrow anything from these location in the optic to construct
  a new major version of the Tushell platform (which has a Web UI prototype in @tushellplatform/ and
  a CLI in @tushell/ ).  Many of the explored location will have a "rispecs" folder (see:
  @llms/llms-rise-framework.txt  to understand what they are) and that should make your work
  effective in making the full new rispecs of all that tushell should be about in his platform then
  you will implement in tushellplatform/ (I guess you will write about 50-100 rispecs in
  tushellplatform/rispecs well organized and will ensure that you use existing packages not to
  reinvent the wheel.... ;)

Having a little bit of narrative-driven about Tushell from @stories/Tushell_variations/
  @stories/Tushell_WhisperingData_R2_DevWorkspace/  might help you, Tushell would be part of our
  system into another Universe where he helps write stories, @storytelling/rispecs  should inspire
  you in this regards

CLAUDE in /src/tushellplatform is creating issues and organizing into mino what we are doing....

/rise-pde-session another instance is about todo the work implied in `/b/trading/.pde/1799837b-4411-4a0f-94c6-c99b58cf8bf4.md`,
  you are running within another related context which you can read all the @rispecs/ to understand it and you have access to the
  Make sure to pass 2 decompose to the MCP-pde (not just what I am giving you here, you will have to prepare the land in here for
  doing parts of the work given that this agent has not done the work implied in
  /b/trading/.pde/1799837b-4411-4a0f-94c6-c99b58cf8bf4.md so you will make something in here in the rispecs and you can also edit
  his /b/trading/.pde/1799837b-4411-4a0f-94c6-c99b58cf8bf4.md if needed , I will want mia-code-server to be ready for having such
  capabilities to help us do that job, maybe jgwill/smcraft (which is on what it will work) could become a sub-module here... we
  will see. You have @llms/ to guide you if needed. I am expected to have a .pde/ (or many) out of your process to edit and you will
   wait AT LEST 12 minutes before doing the work that is explaied in the skill, dont fucking waste my premium token by stopping
